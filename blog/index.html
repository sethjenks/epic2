				<p>We are thrilled to announce that we will be concluding what has been an incredible year of growth for Ginger.io by welcoming Vinod Khosla and his team at <a title="Khosla Ventures" href="http://www.khoslaventures.com/">Khosla Ventures</a> to the Ginger.io family. We are delighted to announce our $6.5M Series A funding round led by KV. Seed investors <a title="True Ventures" href="http://www.trueventures.com/">True Ventures</a> and Romulus Capital also participated in the round.</p>
<p>Raising a round of financing is a very important decision for any company, and we spent a lot of time thinking if and why this was appropriate. Given our company focus on keeping populations healthy, the incredible client partnerships we’ve built, and the advancements in healthcare reform, we had the opportunity to grow in a way that would allow us to achieve both business and mission-driven goals. Over the next year, we’ll be using the new capital to scale our team, improve our product, and support existing and new partners.</p>
<p>We also spent a lot of time thinking about who were the right partners to help us grow. We have been incredibly fortunate in the time and effort our seed investors and advisors have devoted to our team. With Khosla and True’s focus on true mentorship to their companies, and commitment to disrupt health care, we are confident about our mission of changing how patients are supported away from the doctor’s office.</p>
<p>The most exciting part of this announcement is that we can find more great people to work with. If you are energized by what we are doing, we are actively hiring for engineering and business development roles in both Boston and San Francisco. To learn more about employment opportunities at Ginger.io, visit: <a title="Join Us" href="http://ginger.io/join-us/">http://ginger.io/join-us/</a>.</p>
<p>We are also actively recruiting individuals living with Diabetes, ADHD, Heart disease, and Crohns &amp; Ulcerative Colitis to help us accelerate the development and deployment of the Ginger.io system by becoming early adopters. More information about signing up is available here: <a title="Contribute" href="http://ginger.io/contribute-to-science/">http://ginger.io/contribute-to-science/</a>.</p>

				<p><em>As this time of year rolls around, it is common to take a moment to reflect on what makes us grateful, as cheesy as it may be. In the spirit of the holiday season, we asked everyone on the team what made them most excited about being a member of the Ginger.io family.</em></p>
<p><strong>Anmol:</strong> I’m truly thankful for being part of amazing team that gets to take the beginning of an idea to something that can broadly change healthcare</p>
<p><strong>Karan:</strong> I am thankful for the chance to build a movement to change health(care), with a team that believes we can.</p>
<p><strong>Andrea:</strong> I am thankful for a team that cares about each other, their clients, their patients and genuinely making a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Julia:</strong> I am thankful to work with an amazing group of people who believe that there is no such thing as a “dumb question.” Everyone is always willing to take the time out to help someone else think through a thorny issue or learn something new.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy:</strong> I&#8217;m thankful for the always-on video chat that connects us to our team on the east coast.<br />
I&#8217;m thankful for having great fro-yo buddies.<br />
I&#8217;m thankful for the free lunch we get every Thursday &#8211; and the people I get to share it with!</p>
<p><strong>Mahesh:</strong> I’m thankful to work with amazing people who are awesome at what they like to do and they are working hard to make sure everyone else on team is awesome!</p>
<p><strong>Sabih:</strong> I’m thankful for the opportunity to work with an amazing group of people dedicated to creating a helpful service, founders who care about the individuals who form this group, and my family for putting up with the ups and downs of startup life.</p>
<p><strong>Sai:</strong> I am thankful to work with a team of intelligent, mission-driven, (and most importantly) rational individuals. I am thankful to be working towards a very worthwhile mission. I am thankful for the abundance of external support we have been able to garner for this mission.</p>

        <h4>Tuesday, November 6, 2012 <br/> by <a href="#">Julia</a></h4>
    </div>

    <div class="span7 blog-post-content">


				<p style="text-align: left;"><em>This is the first in a series of blog posts in which we talk about how we do things at Ginger.io, and what we think we do well.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/Oct-Offsite.jpeg"><img class="span7" title="Oct Offsite" src="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/Oct-Offsite.jpeg" alt="" width="518" height="264" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This past week, Ginger.io East and West gathered for our first full team meet up in a long while. We spent a day debating customer priorities among the vineyards and a day continuing those discussions in San Francisco. At the end of the week, we were all refreshed and ready to push forward.</p>
<p>Given that we spent a lot of time as a team thinking about how to make the most of our time, we wanted to share what worked for us &#8211; and what we will be improving for our next all-hands meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Do&#8230;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;divy up responsibility:</strong> We assigned each team member a topic and a discussion to facilitate. Some of these topics matched to functional role (e.g., sales lead Andrea led the sales update) while some asked people to leave their comfort zone (e.g., engineer Mahesh drove a conversation around hierarchy). Asking people to stretch into a facilitation role and to think about things that may not come up day-to-day helped enrich the conversation and make it more representative of everyone on the team.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;involve outside voices:</strong> One of the highlights of the offsite was having the chance to speak with a number of our investors and advisors, some in person. While this took quite a bit of scheduling gymnastics on the behalf of Anmol (and our investors’ assistants), we relished the chance to ask questions and learn from others’ experience. And we also enjoyed the friendly competition as each speaker tried to provide more pithy insight than the caller who spoke before!</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;have a plan for follow up:</strong> The offsite left us with buzzing minds and an appetite for continuing iteration. Alas, we weren’t as prepared structurally for how we would continue that momentum. Luckily, we were able to flex our Friday calendars for some impromptu brainstorming that helped close the loop on many of our open issues. Since then, we’ve resolved to schedule brainstorming time into every week to close on the remaining topics &#8211; and keep the type of dialogue we started going.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8230;expect to get through everything:</strong> It won’t happen. See the point above re: follow up.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;end the day at 5 PM:</strong> We spent a lot of time during the offsite talking about culture and what it meant to be a team that invested in each other as people, not just as colleagues. Some of the best moments of the two days came after work, over amazing salsa at Papelote or over drinks at a bar (surrounded by other start-up teams, of course). Those memories will be the ones we look back on &#8211; and use to roast each other at the Holiday party.</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;forget to celebrate milestones:</strong> Props to Anmol for this one, who decided last minute that everyone needed a commemorative souvenir. We went with a T-shirt designed around an inside joke, and made sure to give one to everyone who participated and helped our new release. Now, when someone in the office pulls it out of a dresser drawer after a late night, it’ll evoke another late night when we all pulled together.</p>
<p><strong>What tips do you have from your own offsites? What would you recommend we do to make next time even better?</strong></p>

As the <em>Times</em> has expanded its coverage of health-related topics, this has become even more true. This week saw “The Digital Doctor,” a special <em>Science Times</em> section that looks at the intersection between medicine and technology. The entire thing is worth a read — it’s a great blend of factual reporting on how the practice of medicine is changing with more personal reflections on what it means to be a connected doctor.</p>
<p>We’re happy to report that Ginger.io is featured in this special issue, in an <a title="Apps Alert the Doctor When Trouble Looms" href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/apps-alert-the-doctor-when-trouble-looms/?ref=health" target="_blank">article</a> as well as online at the Well blog. The article discusses how Cincinnati Children’s Hospital and Novant Health are using the Ginger.io platform to keep their patients healthy. It’s a balanced, fair read and a good overview of the “Connected Health” space.</p>
<p><em>Tell us what you think about the article &#8211; and about The New York Times’ take on digital care in general. What did they get right, and where do you see things differently?</em></p>

				<p style="text-align: center;"><em>With the recent announcement that the <a href="http://www.hdiforum.org.prod.ngin.com/page/show/454166">2013 Health Datapalooza</a> will be June 3-4, we wanted to reflect back on last June.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><em></em><span style="text-align: left;">We were very excited to be highlighted by McKinsey at the Health Datapalooza this past June. McKinsey Directors David Knott and Steve Van Kuiken gave a fascinating and polished </span><a style="text-align: left;" title="McKinsey Big Data Presentation" href="http://www.hdiforum.org/page/show/538054-value-pathways-big-data-in-healthcare" target="_blank">presentation on Big Data in healthcare</a><span style="text-align: left;"> that highlighted Ginger.io as a company “shaking up traditional approaches to health data.” They’ve just recently passed the document on to us, and we wanted to share it as a “must-read” for anyone interested in health data.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/McKinsey-slide2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter; margin = 10px" style="border: 2px solid black;" title="McKinsey slide" src="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/McKinsey-slide2-1024x744.jpg" alt="" width="697" height="507" /></a></p>
<p>We were particularly struck by a few of the insights &#8211; as recovering consultants ourselves, here are three:</p>
<ul>
<li>Applying early successes at scale could reduce US healthcare costs by $300-450 billion. We are often asked what the market size is for something like Ginger.io. To put a number like this in perspective, this is 11-17% of the $2.6 trillion the US spent on healthcare in 2010.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Patient data should be a “natural resource.” While the idea of data as a commodity or currency is often floated in discussions like this, the natural resource metaphor feels particularly apt.   Patient data is a well that must be tapped carefully to avoid externalities, with proper regulation and security.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are opportunities both for innovators to disrupt, and for existing companies to step up and drive change themselves. For innovators, it is a question of defining the problem and scaling the solution. For established players, it is embracing the transparency and uncertainty that comes with being a leader in a brave new world.</li>
</ul>

				<p>Over the past few months, Ginger.io has been working with the Collaborative Chronic Care Network (C3N) to pilot our behavioral analytics platform with adolescents living with IBD. On August 21, 2012, we held a live webinar during which we presented our project and gave attendees a chance to ask questions.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/C3N-Webinar.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-139" title="C3N Webinar" src="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/C3N-Webinar-300x185.png" alt="C3N, IBD, Crohn's, Passive PRO" width="300" height="185" /></a></p>
<p>Our partners at C3N just posted a fantastic <a title="Big Data Better Health" href="http://c3nproject.org/blog/090712/big-data-better-health">recap</a> of the webinar on their blog, which details how together we are helping people living with IBD.</p>
<p>You can watch the webinar <a title="Webinar" href="http://vimeo.com/48010954" target="_blank">here</a>, and learn more about both C3N and how Ginger.io is allowing people living with IBD to passively track how they’re feeling day-to-do.</p>
<p>If you’d like to participate, you can sign up here:<strong> <a title="Join" href="http://ginger.io/join/c3n/" target="_blank">ginger.io/join/c3n</a>.</strong></p>
<p>We also got some great questions during the webinar, which we wanted to share:</p>
<p><em>“How do you work with patients on product development?”</em></p>
<p>Ginger.io is commiting to involving patients in all steps of our product development &#8211; some of our best feature insights and design ideas have come from patients. To help facilitate that dialogue, we are putting together a Patient Advocacy Council who will be our “feet on the street” in terms of getting user feedback and insight. We’ll be posting more details shortly, but if you’re interested in being part of helping us think through how to best serve our patients, shoot us an email at hello@ginger.io</p>
<p>In addition, C3N also has a Patient Advisory Council. You can find more information on them <a href="http://c3nproject.org/innovations/patient-advisory-council" title="C3N PAC" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>“Does Ginger.io send active alerts about patients to physicians?”</em></p>
<p>One of the most important features is the ability of Ginger.io to connect patients and physicians. Right now, all our Physicians use our web dashboard. This dashboard allows them to see how their patients are doing. We are working on other ways to alert physicians &#8211; let us know if you have suggestions! We also are working on alerts that go to the loved ones of patients, as well as directly to the patient herself.</p>
<p>Are there other questions you have that didn’t get answered in the webinar? <strong>Send us an email at hello@ginger.io!</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: left;"> The United States spends vastly more money than any other country in the world on health care, yet we still lag behind on key health indicators like <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html">life expectancy</a>, <a href="http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/Chartbooks/2008/Mar/Racial-and-Ethnic-Disparities-in-U-S--Health-Care--A-Chartbook.aspx">access to health care,</a> or <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa022615">meeting standard clinical guidelines</a>. The Affordable Care Act is an attempt to correct this, but it is a daunting aim for one bill to achieve. One of the biggest problems facing those attempting health care reform is the complexity of how to form solutions to epidemic overspending and poor quality. It’s not obvious at all how to fit the pieces together, at least until reading the<a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1114777?query=health-policy-and-reform&amp;"> lucid and readable perspective</a> of Harvey Fineberg, president of the Institute of Medicine, in a recent issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Dr. Fineberg points out that health information technology (IT) is a crucial part of “the solution” to making health reform work:<strong><strong><br />
</strong></strong></p>
<p>“… The burgeoning availability of data provide a foundation for new functionality in health IT, which is already beginning to show promise as a way of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of care. When this functionality is combined with other advances in such areas as high-speed network connectivity, geospatial positioning capacity, wireless communication, robotics and artificial intelligence, biosensor technology, bioinformatics, and ingenious applications, one can envision an array of interrelated and interconnected uses of health IT …”</p>
<p>He lists several “Potential Uses of Health IT” which should sound familiar to anyone in the mobile health community:</p>
<ul>
<li>personal medical records</li>
<li>personalized health reminders and follow-up</li>
<li>personal health, diet and activity monitoring and motivation</li>
<li>monitoring and advising of patients with chronic disease</li>
<li>enhanced peer-to-peer and professional-patient support</li>
</ul>
<p>As an advocate for the potential of mobile health, I was very excited to read these priorities coming from the president of the Institute of Medicine, an incredibly influential force in health care. Dr. Fineberg recognizes that mobile health, at its best, bridges the enormous gap of care that happens between doctor’s visits and hospital admissions. I’d like to take his points a step further, and illustrate the ways in which mobile technology can deliver some of the “potential uses” that he outlines:</p>
<p><strong>1) Personal medical records: </strong></p>
<p>Mobile personal health records which can interface with the electronic health systems used by physicians could improve consistency of care by enabling patients to always have an accurate copy of their medical record wherever they travel. As the <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/update-on-google-health-and-google.html">failed Google Health project</a> taught us, you can’t expect any but the most motivated consumers to proactively track their own health data. But there are mountains of health data recorded every second that could be easily coordinated with software owned by the patient. Since we are unlikely to ever have a national health IT system, the next best option could be to have every patient in the US own their entire, up-to-date medical record.</p>
<p><strong>2) Improving chronic illness data collection: </strong></p>
<p>The US is becoming <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/overview/index.htm">a nation of chronic illness:</a> in 2005, 133 million Americans had at least one chronic illness. The top players in chronic illness include morbid obesity, diabetes, asthma, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/copd/">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_failure">congestive heart failure.</a> All of these illnesses require active participation by patients to reduce complications from the illness. Diabetics must check and record their blood sugars, asthma and COPD patients monitor peak flows, and heart failure patients track their weight.  Mobile apps can be a key solution for reinforcing healthy daily routines through intelligent reminders which can personalized for each user. It’s amazing for me to think that as a physician, I often have a visiting nurse assigned to my more complex chronic illness patients who help record this data and check in with patients, when this can clearly be done effectively with a single smartphone with the right software. This would enable visiting nurses and other caregivers to focus on care delivery and interpreting clinical data rather than measuring it.</p>
<p><strong>3) Creating new passive tracking tools: </strong></p>
<p>There is also the frontier of using a combination of passive and/or active tracking to follow patient’s progress and response to new trials of medication (this is the approach that Ginger.io takes). As I mentioned, there is a huge gap between the time when patients intersect with health care providers and the rest of their lives, when everything else happens. As health providers, we can often be deluded into thinking that our influence persists between infrequent visits. In most cases, nothing horrible happens if someone doesn’t floss very often or forgets to refill their statin prescription one month. But for patients with chronic illness, one or more months of lapsing on their medications or self-care can have disastrous and expensive consequences: emergency room visits, hospital admissions, multiple provider visits to re-establish control of the chronic condition. We can improve on this system with more intelligent tracking that patients and physicians both participate in to catch decompensation early.</p>

<p><em>Mishal was Ginger.io’s summer engineering intern (you can read more about his story <a href="http://blog.ginger.io/an-interns-story/">here</a>). Because Ginger.io is all about transparency, we asked him to make his exit interview public. Below is his advice to other interns &#8211; and to us &#8211; about how to shape a memorable, valuable and fun summer experience:</em></p>
<p><strong>What startups should do:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make the intern gain ownership of his or her project</li>
<li>Let the intern get used to the codebase.</li>
<li>3-4 weeks into the internship, have an actual talk about the direction of the internship. At this point, question them: do you know what you’re doing? Karan asked me this question and it made me focus on getting the dashboard to be a “pulse of the community.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What interns should do:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Find Mentors</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Have a specific mentor, someone who is willing to help you. Web Engineer Jimmy was AWESOME! I learned a lot.</li>
<li>Take a different member of the team out to lunch whenever you can.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Always Ask</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you know why you’re doing what you’re doing.</li>
<li>Ask people for help. People might look busy and you might not want to interfere, but in the end asking is the way to go. This was hard for me to learn as I usually tried to not interfere in other’s work, but it was really important.</li>
<li>Ask questions, as it’s the way to learn. “An internship is about learning,” is what I’ve heard. And I think that’s true. I’ve learned very much about software development this summer.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Take Initiative</span></p>
<ul>
<li>When you’ve nothing to do, find something to do. Ask anyone if you can help them with their current task. I had to do this once and asked Sabih, our designer. I was able to help with getting the mobile version of our blog to render properly on mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

				<p><a href="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/Mishal-shirt.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-130" style="margin: 5px;" title="Mishal shirt" src="http://blog.ginger.io/assets/Mishal-shirt-300x291.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="291" /></a>Ginger.io and I were paired through the <a href="http://startupsummer.com/">Startup Summer</a> program, which matched my interests in web programming and healthcare with Ginger.io’s needs. These past two months, I worked on a project involving data manipulation and visualization.  Being at Ginger.io gave me practical engineering experience, as well as a chance to learn about working as part of a team and helping a growing company tell its story.</p>
<p>One Friday evening, Anmol, Jimmy and I went out to dinner and to check out an ice cream shop near Dolores Park. I used that time to question them about a career as a software programmer. While originally trying to get a feel for one career path, I learned a larger life lesson: everyone’s life has a theme. It’s your ability to identify that theme and create a compelling story around it that makes you appeal to others and allows them to join in your aspiration.</p>
<p>One example is our own story here at Ginger.io, where we are creating a product that allows for a more accurate picture of what happens for a patient between doctor visits. I’ve heard many times that more than the idea, it’s the people that make a startup successful. It’s true. When a cohesive team rallies behind a single story, it’s possible to bring that dream to fruition.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, writing good code is like writing a story. As a web programming intern, I was exposed to production code, which makes me question the maintainability of my code as I am writing. Halfway through my internship, I read a quote that went something along the lines of “a collaborative programming project should look as if it has been written by one person.” This made me change my outlook of coding from getting a function to produce the expected output, to writing a function that’s maintainable as well. Because as an intern, I’ll not always be here to guide people through my code.</p>
<p>Having worked on the same project over the course of the summer, I realized that though I may have written some code, it doesn’t mean that I will be familiar with it several months from now. A well placed comment and appropriate variable names can go a long way in terms of code readability.</p>
<p>I will miss the team after returning to school for my Senior year at Harvard. I am looking forward to the learning and fun that happens during the semester, but I’m also looking forward to the two weeks before the semester starts when I can spend time with family and reflect on the lessons that I’ve learned about both personal and software development.<br />
